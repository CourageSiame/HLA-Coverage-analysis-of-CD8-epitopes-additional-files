# HLA-Coverage-analysis-of-CD8-epitopes-additional-files
This Repository contains additional files that support the results report in "An in silico analysis of population HLA coverage of experimentally characterized P. falciparum epitopes as components of a multiepitope malaria vaccine" by Siame et al. 

Supplementary file 1 consists of 3 sheets. 
  ~Sheet 1:Population coverage(IEDB), contains the IEDB output for HLA coverage across West Africa, Southwest Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, South America, South Africa, Northeast Asia, North America, North Africa, Europe, East Asia, East Africa, Central America, Central Africa, and the World. 
  ~Sheet 2: CSP epitopes conservancy, shows conservancy of the epitopes across the 16 diverse malaria strains.
  ~Sheet 3: AMA1 epitopes conservancy, shows conservancy of the epitopes across the 16 diverse malaria strains.
  ~Sheet 4: TRAP epitopes conservancy, shows conservancy of the epitopes across the 16 diverse malaria strains.
